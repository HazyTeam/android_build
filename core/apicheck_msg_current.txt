You have tried to change the API from what has been previously approved.

To make these errors go away, you have two choices:
   1) You can add "@hide" javadoc comments to the methods, etc. listed in the
      errors above.

   2) You can update current.txt by executing the following command:
         make update-api
<<<<<<< HEAD

      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      NO. NO. STOP BEING LAZY. SERIOUSLY.
      DO NOT DO THIS in CM. THIS IS A LIE. IT WILL BREAK THINGS.

      To submit the revised current.txt to the main Android repository,
      you will need approval.
